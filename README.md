## Problem description:
See introduction of project proposal.

## Why this problem matters:
See introduction of project proposal.

## How to measure success:
See introduction of project proposal.

## Datasets:
* Observational datasets will initially be synthetic. We propose
  a generalization to the Billiards task introduced in [Sutskever et al.(2009)](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/3567-the-recurrent-temporal-restricted-boltzmann-machine)


## Extracting Data - Preprocessing details:
* Data will initially be synthetic.

Below you will find other relevant material to this project. This short list already assumes a familiarity 
with common deep neural networks (RNNs, CNNs) and training procedures (BPTT).

## Contribute:
To contribute to this project, please familiarize yourself with the Relevant
Work.  Once you are comfortable with this literature, you may create a new
branch then begin work on an open GitHub issue.  This process is experimental, 
but we will establish a review process for new code pull requests.  We will 
seek to establish unit tests as well as performance tests on tasks as new 
modules are created. 

### Observational
We propose first investigating an extension to the Billiards task introduced in
[Sutskever et al.
(2009)](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/3567-the-recurrent-temporal-restricted-boltzmann-machine)


### Reinforcement Learning
We may simultaneously investigate the consciousness prior in the context of
reinforcement learning.
