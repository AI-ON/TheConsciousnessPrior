## Project Status:
* Initial exploration of consciousness prior in a purely observational setting.
* Constructing environments to test efficacy of CP in tracking objects,
  particularly when the task is complicated with high-entropy observations in
the pixel space.

## Problem description:
See introduction of project proposal.

## Why this problem matters:
See introduction of project proposal.

## How to measure success:
See introduction of project proposal.

## Datasets:
* Observational datasets will initially be synthetic. We propose
  a generalization to the Billiards task introduced in [Sutskever et al.(2009)](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/3567-the-recurrent-temporal-restricted-boltzmann-machine)


## Extracting Data - Preprocessing details:
* Data will initially be synthetic.

## Relevant Work:
Below you will find other relevant material to this project. This short list already assumes a familiarity 
with common deep neural networks (RNNs, CNNs) and training procedures (BPTT).

## Contribute:
To contribute to this project:

1. Sign up for the [Slack
   Channel](https://join.slack.com/t/theconsciousnessprior/shared_invite/enQtMjgwMTY4OTczODc2LTdmMDFjM2ViMDk0ZTc5YWRmMDNhZGU4ZTJiMGYzYmYwMTI4NTIyY2RmODYzYjE3MmYwOTNmNGU5NzkwYTM0MDc) and [Google
   Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/the-consciousness-prior).
2. Please familiarize yourself with the Relevant Work.  
3. Create a new branch and then begin work on an open GitHub issue. Coordinate
   with others on Slack so that work is not duplicated unnecessarily.  

The AI-ON process is experimental, but we will establish a review process for new code pull requests.  We will seek to establish unit tests as well as performance tests on tasks as new 
modules are created. 

### Observational
We propose first investigating an extension to the Billiards task introduced in
[Sutskever et al.
(2009)](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/3567-the-recurrent-temporal-restricted-boltzmann-machine)


### Reinforcement Learning
We may simultaneously investigate the consciousness prior in the context of
reinforcement learning, where the agent is in influencing the sensory input via
control.
