# Experiments
We propose investigating the consciousness prior in both a reinforcement
learning or in an purely observation setting.  

## Observational
We propose first investigating an extension to the Billiards task introduced in
[Sutskever et al.
(2009)](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/3567-the-recurrent-temporal-restricted-boltzmann-machine)


## Reinforcement Learning
